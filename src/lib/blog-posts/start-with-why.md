# Start With Why
Most people can tell you *what* they do, but few can tell you *why* they do it. Can you?

Almost without fail, when I explain Strive Planner to people, they come back with the question, "Do you know there are a lot of other task management and productivity apps out there?" It always makes me laugh a little because you'd think if I'd found a productivity app that I liked as much as Strive, I never would've built it.

They bring up a good point though. What really does separate Strive Planner from the millions of other productivity and task management apps?

The answer is the *why*.

All the other tools I've found are really good at helping you understand "what" you're doing in a day, but none help you understand "why" you do what you do. Strive is built to fill that gap.

Each morning you wake up and add your intention into Strive: "What matters most today?"

Unlike other apps that focus only on schedules and to-dos, Strive helps you create and connect goals and people to your events.

When you start with the why, when you focus on the why, you won't just get places, you'll get to *the right* places.
## Conclusion

I challenge you to make one goal in Strive and then schedule some events to work toward that goal. As you begin to fill your day with meaningful activities, you'll feel more fulfilled, more energized, and overall more excited about life. I know because I've experienced it myself!

Have a great week!
